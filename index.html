<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>User latency is an important quality benchmark for Web
Applications. While JavaScript-based mechanisms can provide
comprehensive instrumentation for user latency measurements within
an application, in many cases, they are unable to provide a
complete end-to-end latency picture. This document introduces the
<a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> interface to allow JavaScript
mechanisms to collect complete timing information related to
resources on a document. Navigation Timing 2
[[NAVIGATION-TIMING-2]] extends this specification to provide
additional timing information associated with a navigation.</p>
<p>For example, the following JavaScript shows a simple attempt to
measure the time it takes to fetch a resource:</p>
<pre class='example highlight'>
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body onload="loadResources()"&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        function loadResources()
        {
           var start = new Date().getTime();
           var image1 = new Image();
           var resourceTiming = function() {
               var now = new Date().getTime();
               var latency = now - start;
               alert("End to end resource fetch: " + latency);
           };

           image1.onload = resourceTiming;
           image1.src = 'https://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_main.png';
        }
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_home.png"&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>Though this script can measure the time it takes to fetch a
resource, it cannot break down the time spent in various phases.
Further, the script cannot easily measure the time it takes to
fetch resources described in markup.</p>
<p>To address the need for complete information on user experience,
this document introduces the <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a>
interface. This interface allows JavaScript mechanisms to provide
complete client-side latency measurements within applications. With
this interface, the previous example can be modified to measure a
user's perceived load time of a resource.</p>
<p>The following script calculates the amount of time it takes to
fetch every resource in the page, even those defined in markup.
This example assumes that this page is hosted on
https://www.w3.org. One could further measure the amount of time it
takes in every phase of fetching a resource with the
<a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> interface.</p>
<pre class='example highlight'>
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body onload="loadResources()"&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
       function loadResources()
       {
          var image1 = new Image();
          image1.onload = resourceTiming;
          image1.src = 'https://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_main.png';
       }

       function resourceTiming()
       {
           var resourceList = window.performance.getEntriesByType("resource");
           for (i = 0; i &lt; resourceList.length; i++)
           {
              if (resourceList[i].initiatorType == "img")
              {
                 alert("End to end resource fetch: " + (resourceList[i].responseEnd - resourceList[i].startTime));
              }
           }
       }
    &lt;/script&gt;

<section id="conformance">
<p>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms
(such as "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and
abort these steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the
key word ("MUST", "SHOULD", "MAY", etc) used in introducing the
algorithm.</p>
<p>Some conformance requirements are phrased as requirements on
attributes, methods or objects. Such requirements are to be
interpreted as requirements on user agents.</p>
<p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps
may be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is
equivalent. (In particular, the algorithms defined in this
specification are intended to be easy to follow, and not intended
to be performant.)</p>

<section id="terminology">
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>The construction "a <code>Foo</code> object", where
<code>Foo</code> is actually an interface, is sometimes used
instead of the more accurate "an object implementing the interface
<code>Foo</code>.</p>
<p>The term <dfn>DOM</dfn> is used to refer to the API set made
available to scripts in Web applications, and does not necessarily
imply the existence of an actual <a data-cite=
"DOM#document">Document</a> object or of any other <a data-cite=
"DOM#node">Node</a> objects as defined in the [[DOM]]
specification.</p>
<p>A DOM attribute is said to be <dfn>getting</dfn> when its value
is being retrieved (such as by author script), and is said to be
<dfn>setting</dfn> when a new value is assigned to it.</p>
<p>The term <dfn>JavaScript</dfn> is used to refer to ECMA262,
rather than the official term ECMAScript, since the term JavaScript
is more widely known. [[ECMASCRIPT]]</p>
<p>The term <dfn>resource</dfn> is used to refer to elements and
any other user-initiated fetches throughout this specification. For
example, a resource could originate from XMLHttpRequest objects
[[XHR]], HTML elements [[HTML]] such as iframe, img, script,
object, embed, and link with the link type of stylesheet, and SVG
elements [[SVG11]] such as svg.</p>
<p>The term <dfn>cross-origin</dfn> is used to mean non
<a data-cite="HTML#same-origin">same origin</a>.</p>
<p>The term <dfn>current document</dfn> refers to the document
associated with the <a data-cite=
"HTML#concept-document-window">Window object's newest Document
object</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout this work, all time values are measured in
milliseconds since the start of navigation of the document
[[HR-TIME-2]]. For example, the <a data-cite=
"NAVIGATION-TIMING-2#dom-PerformanceNavigationTiming-startTime">start
of navigation of the document</a> occurs at time 0.</p>
<p>The term <dfn>current time</dfn> refers to the number of
milliseconds since the start of navigation of the document until
the current moment in time.</p>
<p class='note'>This definition of time is based on the High
Resolution Time specification [[HR-TIME-2]] and is different from
the definition of time used in the Navigation Timing specification
[[NAVIGATION-TIMING-2]], where time is measured in milliseconds
since midnight of January 1, 1970 (UTC).</p>

<h3>Resources Included in the <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a>
Interface</h3>
<p>All resource <dfn data-cite="Fetch#concept-request">Request</dfn>s
<a data-cite="FETCH#concept-fetch">fetched</a> by a non-null <dfn
data-cite="Fetch#concept-request-client">client</dfn> MUST be included as
<a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> objects in the <a>client</a>'s <dfn
data-cite="HTML#concept-settings-object-global">global object</dfn>'s
<a data-cite=
"PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a>, unless excluded from the timeline as part of the <a
href="FETCH#concept-fetch">fetching process</a>.
Resources that are retrieved from
<a data-cite="HTML#relevant-application-cache">relevant
application caches</a> or local resources MUST be included as
<a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> objects in the <a data-cite=
"PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a> [[PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2]]. Resources for which the
<a data-cite="FETCH#concept-fetch">fetch</a> was initiated, but was
later aborted (e.g. due to a network error) MAY be included as
<a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> objects in the <a data-cite=
"PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a> and MUST contain initialized attribute values for
processed substeps of the
<a href="FETCH#concept-fetch">fetching process</a>.</p>
<p>The rest of this section is non-normative.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the same canonical URL is used as the <code>src</code>
attribute of two HTML <code>IMG</code> elements, the <a data-cite=
"FETCH#concept-fetch">fetch</a> of the resource initiated by the
first HTML <code>IMG</code> element SHOULD be included as a
<a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> object in the <a data-cite=
"PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a>. The user agent might not re-request the URL for the
second HTML <code>IMG</code> element, instead using the existing
download it initiated for the first HTML <code>IMG</code> element.
In this case, the <a data-cite="FETCH#concept-fetch">fetch</a> of
the resource by the first <code>IMG</code> element would be the
only occurrence in the <a data-cite=
"PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a>.</li>
<li>If the <code>src</code> attribute of a HTML <code>IMG</code>
element is changed via script, both the <a data-cite=
"FETCH#concept-fetch">fetch</a> of the original resource as well as
the <a data-cite="FETCH#concept-fetch">fetch</a> of the new URL
would be included as <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> objects in
the <a data-cite=
"PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a>.</li>
<li>If an HTML <code>IFRAME</code> element is added via markup
without specifying a <code>src</code> attribute, the user agent may
load the <code>about:blank</code> document for the
<code>IFRAME</code>. If at a later time the <code>src</code>
attribute is changed dynamically via script, the user agent may
<a data-cite="FETCH#concept-fetch">fetch</a> the new URL resource
for the <code>IFRAME</code>. In this case, only the <a data-cite=
"FETCH#concept-fetch">fetch</a> of the new URL would be included as
a <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> object in the <a data-cite=
"PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a>.</li>
<li>If an <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> is generated twice for the
same canonical URL, both <a data-cite=
"FETCH#concept-fetch">fetches</a> of the resource would be included
as a <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> object in the <a data-cite=
"PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a>. This is because the <a data-cite=
"FETCH#concept-fetch">fetch</a> of the resource for the second
<code>XMLHttpRequest</code> cannot reuse the download issued for
the first <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>.</li>
<li>If an HTML <code>IFRAME</code> element is included on the page,
then only the resource requested by <code>IFRAME</code>
<code>src</code> attribute is included as a
<a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> object in the <a data-cite=
"PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a>. Sub-resources requested by the <code>IFRAME</code>
document will be included in the <code>IFRAME</code> document's
<a data-cite=
"PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a> and not the parent document's <a data-cite=
"PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a>.</li>
<li>If an HTML <code>IMG</code> element has a <code><a href=
"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2397">data: URI</a></code> as its
source [[RFC2397]], then this resource will not be included as a
<a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> object in the <a data-cite=
"PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a>. By definition <code><a href=
"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2397">data: URI</a></code> contains
embedded data and does not require a <a data-cite=
"FETCH#concept-fetch">fetch</a>.</li>
<li>If a resource <a data-cite="FETCH#concept-fetch">fetch</a> was
aborted due to a networking error (e.g. DNS, TCP, or TLS error),
then the fetch MAY be included as a
<a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> object in the <a data-cite=
"PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a> with initialized attribute values up to the point of
failure - e.g. a TCP handshake error should report DNS timestamps
for the request, and so on.</li>
<li>If a resource <a data-cite="FETCH#concept-fetch">fetch</a> is
aborted because it failed a fetch precondition (e.g. mixed content,
CORS restriction, CSP policy, etc), then this resource SHOULD NOT
not be included as a <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> object in the
<a data-cite=
"PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a>.</li>

<p>The user agent MAY choose to limit how many resources are
included as <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> objects in the
<a data-cite=
"PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a> [[PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2]]. This section extends the
<a data-cite=
"PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2#dom-performance"><code>Performance</code></a>
interface to allow controls over the number of
<a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> objects stored.</p>
<p>The recommended minimum number of
<a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> objects is 250, though this may be
changed by the user agent. <a data-link-for=
"Performance">setResourceTimingBufferSize</a> can be called to
request a change to this limit.</p>

<p>Each <a data-cite="WEBIDL#es-environment">ECMAScript global
environment</a> has:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <dfn>resource timing buffer size limit</dfn> which should
initially be 250 or greater.</li>
<li>A <dfn>resource timing buffer current size</dfn> which is
initially 0.</li>
<li>A <dfn>resource timing buffer full event pending flag</dfn> which is
initially false.</li>
<li>A <dfn>resource timing secondary buffer current size</dfn>
which is initially 0.</li>
<li>A <dfn>resource timing secondary buffer</dfn> to store
<a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> objects that is initially empty.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="idl" data-cite="HTML">partial interface Performance {
  undefined clearResourceTimings ();
  undefined setResourceTimingBufferSize (unsigned long maxSize);
              attribute EventHandler onresourcetimingbufferfull;
};
</pre>
<p>The <dfn>Performance</dfn> interface is defined in
[[HR-TIME-2]].</p>
<p>The method <dfn>clearResourceTimings</dfn> runs the following
steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove all <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> objects in the
<a data-cite=
'PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2#dfn-performance-entry-buffer'>performance
entry buffer</a>.</li>
<li>Set <a>resource timing buffer current size</a> to 0.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <dfn>setResourceTimingBufferSize</dfn> method runs the
following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set <a>resource timing buffer size limit</a> to the
<i>maxSize</i> parameter. If the <i>maxSize</i> parameter is less
than <a>resource timing buffer current size</a>, no
<a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> objects are to be removed from the
<a data-cite=
'PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2#dfn-performance-entry-buffer'>performance
entry buffer</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The attribute <dfn>onresourcetimingbufferfull</dfn> is the event
handler for the <dfn>resourcetimingbufferfull</dfn> event described
below.</p>

<p>To check if <dfn>can add resource timing entry</dfn>, run the following
steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>If <a>resource timing buffer current size</a> is smaller than <a>resource
timing buffer size limit</a>, return true.</li>
<li>Return false.</li>
</ol>

<p>To <dfn>add a PerformanceResourceTiming entry</dfn> into the <a data-cite=
'PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2/#dfn-performance-entry-buffer'>performance
entry buffer</a>, run the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Let <i>new entry</i> be the input <a>PerformanceEntry</a> to be added.
<li>If <a>can add resource timing entry</a> returns true and <a>resource
timing buffer full event pending flag</a> is false, run the following substeps:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin;">
<li>Add <i>new entry</i> to the <a data-cite=
'PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2#dfn-performance-entry-buffer'>performance
entry buffer</a>.</li>
<li>Increase <a>resource timing buffer current size</a> by 1.</li>
<li>Return.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If <a>resource timing buffer full event pending flag</a> is false, run the
following substeps:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin;">
<li>Set <a>resource timing buffer full event pending flag</a> to true.</li>
<li><a>Queue a task</a> on the <a href=
  "https://w3c.github.io/performance-timeline/#dfn-performance-timeline-task-source">performance
  timeline task source</a> to run <a>fire a buffer full event</a>.</li>
</ol>
<li>Add <i>new entry</i> to the <a>resource timing secondary buffer</a>.</li>
<li>Increase <a>resource timing secondary buffer current size</a> by 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>To <dfn>copy secondary buffer</dfn>, run the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>While <a>resource timing secondary buffer</a> is not empty and
<a>can add resource timing entry</a> returns true, run the following substeps:
<ol>
<li>Let <i>entry</i> be the oldest <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> in
<a>resource timing secondary buffer</a>.</li>
<li>Add <i>entry</i> to the end of <a data-cite=
"PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2/#dfn-performance-entry-buffer">performance entry
buffer</a>.</li>
<li>Increment <a>resource timing buffer current size</a> by 1.</li>
<li>Remove <i>entry</i> from <a>resource timing secondary buffer</a>.</li>
<li>Decrement <a>resource timing secondary buffer current size</a> by 1.
</li>
</ol>
</ol>

<p>To <dfn>fire a buffer full event</dfn>, run the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>While <a>resource timing secondary buffer</a> is not empty, run the
following substeps:
<ol>
<li>Let <i>number of excess entries before</i> be <a>resource timing secondary
buffer current size</a>.</li>
<li>If <a>can add resource timing entry</a> returns false, then <a
data-cite="DOM/#concept-event-fire">fire an event</a> named
<code>resourcetimingbufferfull</code> at the <a data-cite=
"HR-TIME-2/#idl-def-performance">Performance</a> object.</li>
<li>Run <a>copy secondary buffer</a>.</li>
<li>Let <i>number of excess entries after</i> be <a>resource timing secondary
buffer current size</a>.</li>
<li>If <i>number of excess entries before</i> is lower than or equals
<i>number of excess entries after</i>, then remove all entries from
<a>resource timing secondary buffer</a>, set <a>resource timing
secondary buffer current size</a> to 0, and abort these steps.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Set <a>resource timing buffer full event pending flag</a> to false.
<p class=note>This means that if the <code>resourcetimingbufferfull</code>
event handler does not add more room in the buffer than it adds resources to
it, excess entries will be dropped from the buffer. Developers should make sure
that <code>resourcetimingbufferfull</code> event handlers call
<code>clearResourceTimings</code> or extend the buffer sufficiently (by calling
<code>setResourceTimingBufferSize</code>).</p>

 <h3>Cross-origin Resources</h3>
 <p class="note" data-dfn-for="PerformanceResourceTiming">As detailed in [=fetch=],
 cross-origin resources are included as <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> objects in the
 <a data-cite="PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2#performance-timeline">Performance
 Timeline</a>. If the <a href="FETCH#concept-tao-check">timing allow check</a> algorithm
 fails for a resource, these attributes of its <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a>
 object are set to zero:
{{PerformanceResourceTiming/redirectStart}}, {{PerformanceResourceTiming/redirectEnd}},
{{PerformanceResourceTiming/domainLookupStart}}, {{PerformanceResourceTiming/domainLookupEnd}},
{{PerformanceResourceTiming/connectStart}}, {{PerformanceResourceTiming/connectEnd}},
{{PerformanceResourceTiming/requestStart}}, {{PerformanceResourceTiming/responseStart}},
{{PerformanceResourceTiming/secureConnectionStart}}, {{PerformanceResourceTiming/transferSize}},
{{PerformanceResourceTiming/encodedBodySize}}, and {{PerformanceResourceTiming/decodedBodySize}}.</p>
 <p class="note">Server-side applications may return the
 <a data-cite="FETCH#concept-tao-check">Timing-Allow-Origin</a>
 HTTP response header to allow the User
 Agent to fully expose, to the document origin(s) specified, the
 values of attributes that would have been zero due to the
 <a>cross-origin</a> restrictions previously specified in this
 section.</p>
<section id="sec-timing-allow-origin"> 
 <h4><code>Timing-Allow-Origin</code> Response Header</h4>
<p class="note">This section is non-normative.</p>
 <p>The <dfn>Timing-Allow-Origin</dfn> HTTP response header field
 can be used to communicate a policy indicating origin(s) that are
 allowed to see values of attributes that would have been zero due
 to the cross-origin restrictions. The header's value is represented
 by the following ABNF [[RFC5234]] (using <a data-cite=
 "RFC7230#section-7">List Extension</a>, [[RFC7230]]):</p>
 <pre class="abnf">
       Timing-Allow-Origin = 1#( <a data-cite=
 "FETCH#origin-header">origin-or-null</a> / <a data-cite=
 "FETCH#http-new-header-syntax">wildcard</a> )
     </pre>
 <p>The sender MAY generate multiple <a>Timing-Allow-Origin</a>
 header fields. The recipient MAY combine multiple
 <a>Timing-Allow-Origin</a> header fields by appending each
 subsequent field value to the combined field value in order,
 separated by a comma.</p>
 <p>The <dfn>timing allow check</dfn> algorithm, which checks
whether a resource's timing information can be shared with the
 <a>current document</a>, is as follows:</p>
 <ol>
     <li>Let <var>response</var> be the resource's <a data-cite=
       "FETCH#concept-response">Response</a>.</li>
     <li>Return <var>response</var>'s <a data-cite=
       "FETCH#concept-response-timing-allow-passed">
       timing allow passed flag</a>.</li>
 </ol>
 <p class=note>The Timing-Allow-Origin header may arrive as part of a cached
 response. In case of cache revalidation, according to
 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-4.3.4">RFC 7234</a>,
 the header's value may come from the revalidation response, or if not present
 there, from the original cached resource.</p>

<section id="sec-privacy-security" class='informative'>
<h2>Privacy and Security</h2>
<p>The <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> interface exposes timing
information for a resource to any web page or worker that has
requested that resource. To limit the access to the
<a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> interface, the <a data-cite=
"HTML#same-origin">same origin</a> policy is enforced by default
and certain attributes are set to zero, as described in [=/HTTP fetch=]. Resource providers can
explicitly allow all timing information to be collected for a
resource by adding the [=request/timing allow failed flag|Timing Allow Origin=] HTTP response
header, which specifies the domains that are allowed to access the
timing information.</p>
<p>Statistical fingerprinting is a privacy concern where a
malicious web site may determine whether a user has visited a
third-party web site by measuring the timing of cache hits and
misses of resources in the third-party web site. Though the
<a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> interface gives timing information
for resources in a document, the <a data-cite="FETCH#">cross-origin restrictions</a> prevent
making this privacy concern any worse than it is today using the
load event on resources to measure timing to determine cache hits
and misses.</p>
