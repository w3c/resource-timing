<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
User latency is an important quality benchmark for Web Applications. While
JavaScript-based mechanisms can provide comprehensive instrumentation for
user latency measurements within an application, in many cases, they are
unable to provide a complete end-to-end latency picture. This document introduces the <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a>
interface to allow JavaScript mechanisms to collect complete timing
information related to resources on a document. Navigation Timing 2 [[NAVIGATION-TIMING-2]] extends this specification to provide additional timing information associated with a navigation.
</p>


<p>For example, the following JavaScript shows a simple attempt to
measure the time it takes to fetch a resource:</p>

<pre class='example highlight'>
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body onload="loadResources()"&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        function loadResources()
        {
           var start = new Date().getTime();
           var image1 = new Image();
           var resourceTiming = function() {
               var now = new Date().getTime();
               var latency = now - start;
               alert("End to end resource fetch: " + latency);
           };

           image1.onload = resourceTiming;
           image1.src = 'https://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_main.png';
        }
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_home.png"&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<p>Though this script can measure the time it takes to fetch a resource,
it cannot break down the time spent in various phases. Further, the script
cannot easily measure the time it takes to fetch resources described in markup.</p>

<p>To address the need for complete information on user experience, this document
introduces the <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> interface.
This interface allows JavaScript mechanisms to provide complete client-side latency measurements within applications.
With this interface, the previous example can be modified to measure a user's
perceived load time of a resource.
</p>

<p>The following script calculates the amount of time it takes to fetch every resource in the
page, even those defined in markup. This example assumes
that this page is hosted on https://www.w3.org.
One could further measure the amount of time it takes in every phase of fetching a resource
with the <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> interface.
</p>
<pre class='example highlight'>
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body onload="loadResources()"&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
       function loadResources()
       {
          var image1 = new Image();
          image1.onload = resourceTiming;
          image1.src = 'https://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_main.png';
       }

       function resourceTiming()
       {
           var resourceList = window.performance.getEntriesByType("resource");
           for (i = 0; i &lt; resourceList.length; i++)
           {
              if (resourceList[i].initiatorType == "img")
              {
                 alert("End to end resource fetch: " + (resourceList[i].responseEnd - resourceList[i].startTime));
              }
           }
       }
    &lt;/script&gt;

<section id="conformance">

<p>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as
"strip any leading space characters" or "return false and abort these steps")
are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word ("MUST", "SHOULD",
"MAY", etc) used in introducing the algorithm. </p>

<p>Some conformance requirements are phrased as requirements on attributes,
methods or objects. Such requirements are to be interpreted as requirements
on user agents. </p>

<p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be
implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In
particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be
easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.) </p>

<section id="terminology">
<h2>Terminology</h2>

<p>
The construction "a <code>Foo</code> object", where <code>Foo</code> is
actually an interface, is sometimes used instead of the more accurate
"an object implementing the interface <code>Foo</code>.
</p>

<p>The term <dfn>DOM</dfn> is used to refer to the API set made available to scripts in
Web applications, and does not necessarily imply the existence of an actual
<a data-cite="!DOM#document">Document</a> object or of any other <a data-cite="!DOM#node">Node</a> objects as
defined in the [[DOM]] specification.
</p>

<p>A DOM attribute is said to be <dfn>getting</dfn> when its value is being
retrieved (such as by author script), and is said to be <dfn>setting</dfn> when
a new value is assigned to it.</p>

<p>
The term <dfn>JavaScript</dfn> is used to refer to ECMA262, rather than
the official term ECMAScript, since the term JavaScript is more widely
        known. [[ECMASCRIPT]]
      </p>

<p>The term <dfn>resource</dfn> is used to refer to elements and any other user-initiated fetches throughout this specification.
For example, a resource could originate from XMLHttpRequest objects [[XMLHttpRequest]], HTML elements [[HTML5]] such as iframe, img, script, object, embed, and link with the link type of stylesheet, and SVG elements [[SVG11]] such as svg.
</p>

<p>
  The term <dfn>cross-origin</dfn> is used to mean non
  <a data-cite="!rfc6454#section-5">same origin</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The term <dfn>current document</dfn> refers to the document associated with the <a data-cite="!html52/browsers.html#document-associated-with-a-window">Window object's newest Document object</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Throughout this work, all time values are measured in milliseconds since the start of
  navigation of the document [[!HR-TIME-2]]. For example, the <a data-cite="!navigation-timing-2/#dom-PerformanceNavigationTiming-startTime">start of navigation of the document</a>
  occurs at time 0.
</p>
<p>
  The term <dfn>current time</dfn> refers to the number of milliseconds
  since the start of navigation of the document until the current moment in time.
</p>
<p class='note'>
  This definition of time is based on the High Resolution Time specification
  [[HR-TIME-2]] and is different
  from the definition of time used in the Navigation Timing specification
  [[NAVIGATION-TIMING]],
  where time is measured in milliseconds since midnight of January 1, 1970 (UTC).

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
    The <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a>
    interface facilitates timing measurement of downloadable resources. For example, this interface is available for
    <a data-cite="!XMLHttpRequest/#interface-xmlhttprequest">XMLHttpRequest</a> objects [[XMLHttpRequest]], HTML
    elements [[HTML5]] such as
    <a data-cite="!html52/embedded-content-0.html#the-iframe-element">iframe</a>,
    <a data-cite="!html52/embedded-content-0.html#the-img-element">img</a>,
    <a data-cite="!html52/scripting-1.html#the-script-element">script</a>,
    <a data-cite="!html52/embedded-content-0.html#the-object-element">object</a>,
    <a data-cite="!html52/embedded-content-0.html#the-embed-element">embed</a>,
    and <a data-cite="!html52/document-metadata.html#the-link-element">link</a>
    with the link type of
    <a data-cite="!html52/links.html#link-type-stylesheet">stylesheet</a>,
    and SVG elements [[SVG11]] such
    as <a data-cite="!SVG11/struct.html#SVGElement">svg</a>.

<h3>Resources Included in the <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> Interface</h3>

<p>All resources <a data-cite="!html52/infrastructure.html#fetch">fetched</a> by the current <a data-cite="!html52/browsers.html#browsing-context">browsing</a> or worker [[!WORKERS]] context's MUST be included as <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> objects in the <a data-cite="!performance-timeline-2/#sec-performance-timeline">Performance Timeline</a> of the relevant context. Resources that are retrieved from <a data-cite="!html52/browsers.html#relevant-application-cache">relevant application caches</a> or local resources MUST be included as <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> objects in the <a data-cite="!performance-timeline-2/#sec-performance-timeline">Performance Timeline</a> [[!PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2]]. Resources for which the <a data-cite="!html52/infrastructure.html#fetch">fetch</a> was initiated, but was later aborted (e.g. due to a network error) MAY be included as <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> objects in the <a data-cite="!performance-timeline-2/#sec-performance-timeline">Performance Timeline</a> and MUST contain initialized attribute values for processed substeps of the <a href="#processing-model">processing model</a>.</p>

<p>The rest of this section is non-normative.</p>
<p>
    Examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the same canonical URL is used as the <code>src</code> attribute of two HTML <code>IMG</code> elements,
            the <a data-cite="!html52/infrastructure.html#fetch">fetch</a> of the resource initiated by the first HTML <code>IMG</code> element SHOULD
			be included as a <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> object in the <a data-cite="!performance-timeline-2/#sec-performance-timeline">Performance Timeline</a>.
			The user agent might not re-request the URL for the second HTML <code>IMG</code> element, instead using the existing download it initiated for the first HTML <code>IMG</code> element.
            In this case, the <a data-cite="!html52/infrastructure.html#fetch">fetch</a> of the resource by the first
            <code>IMG</code> element would be the only occurrence in the <a data-cite="!performance-timeline-2/#sec-performance-timeline">Performance Timeline</a>.
        </li>
        <li>If the <code>src</code> attribute of a HTML <code>IMG</code> element is changed via script, both the <a data-cite="!html52/infrastructure.html#fetch">fetch</a> of the original resource as well
            as the <a data-cite="!html52/infrastructure.html#fetch">fetch</a> of the new URL would be included as <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> objects in
			the <a data-cite="!performance-timeline-2/#sec-performance-timeline">Performance Timeline</a>.
        </li>
		<li>
			If an HTML <code>IFRAME</code> element is added via markup without specifying a <code>src</code> attribute, the user agent may load the <code>about:blank</code> document for the <code>IFRAME</code>. If at a later time the <code>src</code> attribute is changed dynamically via script, the user agent may
			<a data-cite="!html52/infrastructure.html#fetch">fetch</a> the new URL resource for the <code>IFRAME</code>. In this case, only the
			<a data-cite="!html52/infrastructure.html#fetch">fetch</a> of the new URL would be included
			as a <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> object in the <a data-cite="!performance-timeline-2/#sec-performance-timeline">Performance Timeline</a>.
		</li>
        <li>
            If an <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> is generated twice for the same canonical URL, both <a data-cite="!html52/infrastructure.html#fetch">fetches</a> of the resource would be
            included as a <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> object in the <a data-cite="!performance-timeline-2/#sec-performance-timeline">Performance Timeline</a>.
			This is because the <a data-cite="!html52/infrastructure.html#fetch">fetch</a> of the resource for the second <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> cannot reuse the download issued for the first <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            If an HTML <code>IFRAME</code> element is included on the page, then only the resource requested by <code>IFRAME</code> <code>src</code> attribute is included
            as a <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> object in the <a data-cite="!performance-timeline-2/#sec-performance-timeline">Performance Timeline</a>.
			Sub-resources requested by the <code>IFRAME</code> document will be included in the <code>IFRAME</code> document's <a data-cite="!performance-timeline-2/#sec-performance-timeline">Performance Timeline</a> and not the parent
            document's <a data-cite="!performance-timeline-2/#sec-performance-timeline">Performance Timeline</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            If an HTML <code>IMG</code> element has a <code><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2397">data: URI</a></code> as its source [[!RFC2397]], then this resource will not
            be included as a <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> object in the <a data-cite="!performance-timeline-2/#sec-performance-timeline">Performance Timeline</a>.
			By definition <code><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2397">data: URI</a></code> contains embedded data and does not require a <a data-cite="!html52/infrastructure.html#fetch">fetch</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a resource <a data-cite="!html52/infrastructure.html#fetch">fetch</a> was aborted due to a networking error (e.g. DNS, TCP, or TLS error), then the fetch MAY be included as a <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> object in the <a data-cite="!performance-timeline-2/#sec-performance-timeline">Performance Timeline</a> with initialized attribute values up to the point of failure - e.g. a TCP handshake error should report DNS timestamps for the request, and so on.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a resource <a data-cite="!html52/infrastructure.html#fetch">fetch</a> is aborted because it failed a fetch precondition (e.g. mixed content, CORS restriction, CSP policy, etc), then this resource SHOULD NOT not be included as a <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> object in the <a data-cite="!performance-timeline-2/#sec-performance-timeline">Performance Timeline</a>.
        </li>

<h3>Monotonic Clock</h3>
<p>The value of the timing attributes MUST monotonically increase to ensure timing attributes are not
skewed by adjustments to the system clock while <a data-cite="!html52/infrastructure.html#fetch" title='fetch'>fetching</a> the resource. The difference between any two chronologically
recorded timing attributes MUST never be negative. For all resources, including subdocument resources, the user agent MUST
record the system clock at the beginning of the root document navigation and define subsequent timing attributes in
terms of a monotonic clock measuring time elapsed from the beginning of the navigation.

<h2>Privacy and Security</h2>

<p>The <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> interface exposes timing information for a resource to any web page or worker that has requested that resource. To limit the access to the <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> interface, the <a data-cite="!rfc6454#section-5">same origin</a>
policy is enforced by default and certain attributes are set to zero, as described in <a href="#sec-cross-origin-resources"></a>. Resource providers can
explicitly allow all timing information to be collected for a resource by
adding the <a>Timing-Allow-Origin</a> HTTP response header, which specifies the
domains that are allowed to access the timing information. </p>

<p>
Statistical fingerprinting is a privacy concern where a malicious web site may determine whether a user has visited a third-party web site by measuring the timing of cache hits and misses of resources in the third-party web site. Though the <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> interface gives timing information for resources in a document, the <a href="#sec-cross-origin-resources">cross-origin restrictions</a> prevent making this privacy concern any worse than it is today using the load event on resources to measure timing to determine cache hits and misses.
