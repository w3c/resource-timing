<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>User latency is an important quality benchmark for Web
Applications. While JavaScript-based mechanisms can provide
comprehensive instrumentation for user latency measurements within
an application, in many cases, they are unable to provide a
complete end-to-end latency picture. This document introduces the
<a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> interface to allow JavaScript
mechanisms to collect complete timing information related to
resources on a document. Navigation Timing 2
[[NAVIGATION-TIMING-2]] extends this specification to provide
additional timing information associated with a navigation.</p>
<p>For example, the following JavaScript shows a simple attempt to
measure the time it takes to fetch a resource:</p>
<pre class='example highlight'>
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body onload="loadResources()"&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        function loadResources()
        {
           var start = new Date().getTime();
           var image1 = new Image();
           var resourceTiming = function() {
               var now = new Date().getTime();
               var latency = now - start;
               alert("End to end resource fetch: " + latency);
           };

           image1.onload = resourceTiming;
           image1.src = 'https://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_main.png';
        }
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_home.png"&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>Though this script can measure the time it takes to fetch a
resource, it cannot break down the time spent in various phases.
Further, the script cannot easily measure the time it takes to
fetch resources described in markup.</p>
<p>To address the need for complete information on user experience,
this document introduces the <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a>
interface. This interface allows JavaScript mechanisms to provide
complete client-side latency measurements within applications. With
this interface, the previous example can be modified to measure a
user's perceived load time of a resource.</p>
<p>The following script calculates the amount of time it takes to
fetch every resource in the page, even those defined in markup.
This example assumes that this page is hosted on
https://www.w3.org. One could further measure the amount of time it
takes in every phase of fetching a resource with the
<a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> interface.</p>
<pre class='example highlight'>
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body onload="loadResources()"&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
       function loadResources()
       {
          var image1 = new Image();
          image1.onload = resourceTiming;
          image1.src = 'https://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_main.png';
       }

       function resourceTiming()
       {
           var resourceList = window.performance.getEntriesByType("resource");
           for (i = 0; i &lt; resourceList.length; i++)
           {
              if (resourceList[i].initiatorType == "img")
              {
                 alert("End to end resource fetch: " + (resourceList[i].responseEnd - resourceList[i].startTime));
              }
           }
       }
    &lt;/script&gt;

<section id="conformance">
<p>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms
(such as "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and
abort these steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the
key word ("MUST", "SHOULD", "MAY", etc) used in introducing the
algorithm.</p>
<p>Some conformance requirements are phrased as requirements on
attributes, methods or objects. Such requirements are to be
interpreted as requirements on user agents.</p>
<p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps
may be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is
equivalent. (In particular, the algorithms defined in this
specification are intended to be easy to follow, and not intended
to be performant.)</p>

<section id="terminology">
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>The construction "a <code>Foo</code> object", where
<code>Foo</code> is actually an interface, is sometimes used
instead of the more accurate "an object implementing the interface
<code>Foo</code>.</p>
<p>The term <dfn>DOM</dfn> is used to refer to the API set made
available to scripts in Web applications, and does not necessarily
imply the existence of an actual <a data-cite=
"!DOM#document">Document</a> object or of any other <a data-cite=
"!DOM#node">Node</a> objects as defined in the [[DOM]]
specification.</p>
<p>A DOM attribute is said to be <dfn>getting</dfn> when its value
is being retrieved (such as by author script), and is said to be
<dfn>setting</dfn> when a new value is assigned to it.</p>
<p>The term <dfn>JavaScript</dfn> is used to refer to ECMA262,
rather than the official term ECMAScript, since the term JavaScript
is more widely known. [[ECMASCRIPT]]</p>
<p>The term <dfn>resource</dfn> is used to refer to elements and
any other user-initiated fetches throughout this specification. For
example, a resource could originate from XMLHttpRequest objects
[[XHR]], HTML elements [[HTML]] such as iframe, img, script,
object, embed, and link with the link type of stylesheet, and SVG
elements [[SVG11]] such as svg.</p>
<p>The term <dfn>cross-origin</dfn> is used to mean non
<a data-cite="!RFC6454#section-5">same origin</a>.</p>
<p>The term <dfn>current document</dfn> refers to the document
associated with the <a data-cite=
"!HTML/#concept-document-window">Window object's newest Document
object</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout this work, all time values are measured in
milliseconds since the start of navigation of the document
[[!HR-TIME-2]]. For example, the <a data-cite=
"NAVIGATION-TIMING-2/#dom-PerformanceNavigationTiming-startTime">start
of navigation of the document</a> occurs at time 0.</p>
<p>The term <dfn>current time</dfn> refers to the number of
milliseconds since the start of navigation of the document until
the current moment in time.</p>
<p class='note'>This definition of time is based on the High
Resolution Time specification [[HR-TIME-2]] and is different from
the definition of time used in the Navigation Timing specification
[[NAVIGATION-TIMING-2]], where time is measured in milliseconds
since midnight of January 1, 1970 (UTC).</p>

<h3>Resources Included in the <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a>
Interface</h3>
<p>All resources <a data-cite="!FETCH/#concept-fetch">fetched</a>
by the current <a data-cite="!HTML/#browsing-context">browsing</a>
or worker [[!WORKERS]] context's MUST be included as
<a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> objects in the <a data-cite=
"!PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2/#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a> of the relevant context. Resources that are retrieved
from <a data-cite="!HTML/#relevant-application-cache">relevant
application caches</a> or local resources MUST be included as
<a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> objects in the <a data-cite=
"!PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2/#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a> [[!PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2]]. Resources for which the
<a data-cite="!FETCH/#concept-fetch">fetch</a> was initiated, but
was later aborted (e.g. due to a network error) MAY be included as
<a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> objects in the <a data-cite=
"!PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2/#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a> and MUST contain initialized attribute values for
processed substeps of the <a href="#processing-model">processing
model</a>.</p>
<p>The rest of this section is non-normative.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the same canonical URL is used as the <code>src</code>
attribute of two HTML <code>IMG</code> elements, the <a data-cite=
"!FETCH/#concept-fetch">fetch</a> of the resource initiated by the
first HTML <code>IMG</code> element SHOULD be included as a
<a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> object in the <a data-cite=
"!PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2/#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a>. The user agent might not re-request the URL for the
second HTML <code>IMG</code> element, instead using the existing
download it initiated for the first HTML <code>IMG</code> element.
In this case, the <a data-cite="!FETCH/#concept-fetch">fetch</a> of
the resource by the first <code>IMG</code> element would be the
only occurrence in the <a data-cite=
"!PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2/#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a>.</li>
<li>If the <code>src</code> attribute of a HTML <code>IMG</code>
element is changed via script, both the <a data-cite=
"!FETCH/#concept-fetch">fetch</a> of the original resource as well
as the <a data-cite="!FETCH/#concept-fetch">fetch</a> of the new
URL would be included as <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> objects
in the <a data-cite=
"!PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2/#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a>.</li>
<li>If an HTML <code>IFRAME</code> element is added via markup
without specifying a <code>src</code> attribute, the user agent may
load the <code>about:blank</code> document for the
<code>IFRAME</code>. If at a later time the <code>src</code>
attribute is changed dynamically via script, the user agent may
<a data-cite="!FETCH/#concept-fetch">fetch</a> the new URL resource
for the <code>IFRAME</code>. In this case, only the <a data-cite=
"!FETCH/#concept-fetch">fetch</a> of the new URL would be included
as a <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> object in the <a data-cite=
"!PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2/#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a>.</li>
<li>If an <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> is generated twice for the
same canonical URL, both <a data-cite=
"!FETCH/#concept-fetch">fetches</a> of the resource would be
included as a <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> object in the
<a data-cite=
"!PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2/#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a>. This is because the <a data-cite=
"!FETCH/#concept-fetch">fetch</a> of the resource for the second
<code>XMLHttpRequest</code> cannot reuse the download issued for
the first <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>.</li>
<li>If an HTML <code>IFRAME</code> element is included on the page,
then only the resource requested by <code>IFRAME</code>
<code>src</code> attribute is included as a
<a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> object in the <a data-cite=
"!PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2/#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a>. Sub-resources requested by the <code>IFRAME</code>
document will be included in the <code>IFRAME</code> document's
<a data-cite=
"!PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2/#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a> and not the parent document's <a data-cite=
"!PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2/#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a>.</li>
<li>If an HTML <code>IMG</code> element has a <code><a href=
"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2397">data: URI</a></code> as its
source [[!RFC2397]], then this resource will not be included as a
<a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> object in the <a data-cite=
"!PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2/#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a>. By definition <code><a href=
"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2397">data: URI</a></code> contains
embedded data and does not require a <a data-cite=
"!FETCH/#concept-fetch">fetch</a>.</li>
<li>If a resource <a data-cite="!FETCH/#concept-fetch">fetch</a>
was aborted due to a networking error (e.g. DNS, TCP, or TLS
error), then the fetch MAY be included as a
<a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> object in the <a data-cite=
"!PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2/#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a> with initialized attribute values up to the point of
failure - e.g. a TCP handshake error should report DNS timestamps
for the request, and so on.</li>
<li>If a resource <a data-cite="!FETCH/#concept-fetch">fetch</a> is
aborted because it failed a fetch precondition (e.g. mixed content,
CORS restriction, CSP policy, etc), then this resource SHOULD NOT
not be included as a <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> object in the
<a data-cite=
"!PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE-2/#performance-timeline">Performance
Timeline</a>.</li>

<p data-dfn-for="PerformanceResourceTiming">On getting, the

or local resources, return an empty string. When a proxy is
configured, if a tunnel connection is established then this attribute
MUST return the ALPN Protocol ID of the tunneled protocol, otherwise
it MUST return the ALPN Protocol ID of the first hop to the proxy.
In order to have precisely one way to represent any ALPN protocol ID,
the following additional constraints apply: octets in the ALPN
protocol MUST NOT be percent-encoded if they are valid token
characters except "%", and when using percent-encoding, uppercase hex
digits MUST be used.</p>
<p>Formally registered ALPN protocol IDs are documented by <a href=
"https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-extensiontype-values/tls-extensiontype-values.xhtml#alpn-protocol-ids">
IANA</a>. In case the user agent is using an experimental,
non-registered protocol, the user agent MUST use the ALPN negotiated
value if any. If ALPN was not used for protocol negotiations, the
user agent MAY use another descriptive string.</p>

<p class=note>The "hq" ALPN ID is defined for the final version of
the HTTP over QUIC protocol in the
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-http-11#section-9.1">
HTTP over QUIC Internet Draft</a>.
</p>
<p>Note that the <a data-link-for=
"PerformanceResourceTiming">nextHopProtocol</a> attribute is
intended to identify the network protocol in use for the fetch

specify whether steps 20 and 21 should run before or after the

<h3>Monotonic Clock</h3>
<p>The value of the timing attributes MUST monotonically increase
to ensure timing attributes are not skewed by adjustments to the
system clock while <a data-cite="!FETCH/#concept-fetch" data-lt=
'fetch'>fetching</a> the resource. The difference between any two
chronologically recorded timing attributes MUST never be negative.
For all resources, including subdocument resources, the user agent
MUST record the system clock at the beginning of the root document
navigation and define subsequent timing attributes in terms of a
monotonic clock measuring time elapsed from the beginning of the
navigation.</p>

<h2>Privacy and Security</h2>
<p>The <a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> interface exposes timing
information for a resource to any web page or worker that has
requested that resource. To limit the access to the
<a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> interface, the <a data-cite=
"!RFC6454#section-5">same origin</a> policy is enforced by default
and certain attributes are set to zero, as described in <a href=
"#sec-cross-origin-resources"></a>. Resource providers can
explicitly allow all timing information to be collected for a
resource by adding the <a>Timing-Allow-Origin</a> HTTP response
header, which specifies the domains that are allowed to access the
timing information.</p>
<p>Statistical fingerprinting is a privacy concern where a
malicious web site may determine whether a user has visited a
third-party web site by measuring the timing of cache hits and
misses of resources in the third-party web site. Though the
<a>PerformanceResourceTiming</a> interface gives timing information
for resources in a document, the <a href=
"#sec-cross-origin-resources">cross-origin restrictions</a> prevent
making this privacy concern any worse than it is today using the
load event on resources to measure timing to determine cache hits
and misses.</p>
